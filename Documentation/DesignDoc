Design Issues:

1. Filesystem Structure: 
The filesystem must be able to manage all aspects of the file and directory structure on the disk, including file creation/deletion/manipulation, the organization of the files into easily accesible directories, and disk space management. It must be modular, simple to use, and incur minimal overhead.

The primary components for the ATOS file system will be implemented as follows:

1. Filesystem Design Solution:
In response to the numerous and varied requirements for the filesystem, the filesystem class will serve as the de facto resource manager and handle high-level file and directory manipulation methods, but will leave the low-level disk manipulation to purpose-built file and directory classes. It will also contain pointers to the disk (as specified by the DiskProcessType class) and a data structure that manages the free memory addresses on the disk. By designing the filesystem in this way, the
